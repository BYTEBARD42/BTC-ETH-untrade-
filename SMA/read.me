SMA (Simple Moving Average) Strategy Code
This Python script implements a Simple Moving Average (SMA) based trading strategy. The strategy uses multiple SMAs (with different periods) along with volume conditions to generate buy (long), sell (short), and close signals for trading.

Description:
The script calculates four different SMAs:

SMA1: A short-term SMA (4-period).
SMA2: A medium-term SMA (16-period).
SMA3: A longer-term SMA (32-period).
SMA200: A long-term trend indicator (200-period SMA).
Volume Condition:

The script compares current trading volume with the average volume over a 40-period window. A buy/sell signal is only triggered if the current volume is at least 2.5 times greater than the average volume.
