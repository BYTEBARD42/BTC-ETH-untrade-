Crypto Trading Strategies: EMA, MFI, and SMA
This repository contains three different trading strategies designed for cryptocurrency markets. Each strategy uses a different technical indicator to generate buy, sell, and close signals. The strategies are based on Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Money Flow Index (MFI), and Simple Moving Average (SMA).

Overview:
EMA Strategy: This strategy uses two Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) with periods of 20 and 40 to generate buy and sell signals based on crossovers. The strategy opens a position when the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA and closes it when the opposite crossover occurs.

MFI Strategy: The Money Flow Index (MFI) strategy uses the MFI indicator with thresholds for overbought (UT) and oversold (LT) conditions to determine buy and sell signals. Buy signals are generated when the MFI crosses above the overbought threshold and sell signals when it crosses below the oversold threshold.

SMA Strategy: The Simple Moving Average (SMA) strategy uses four SMAs with different periods (4, 16, 32, and 200) to determine long and short positions. This strategy is combined with a volume condition to filter out weak signals.
